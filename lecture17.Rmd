# Building blocks

What are the basic units of speech. In LING1000 you were introduced to the notion of the "phoneme", or the smallest unit of sound in a language which is ultimately *meaningful* in the sense that it can mark contrast. Phonological contrast is then used to distinguish meaningful utterances as words. If we were to dig deeper into the units of organization within the phoneme, we might consider the notion of a "feature" or "gesture" (articulatory movements).

## Gestural score

If we conceptualize our phonological knowledge in terms of gestures then we can devise models of the implementation of articulatory plans over time $\rightarrow$ gestural score.

In the image above is a hypothetical (and very basic) gestural score for the word "spot" in English. Each gesture is conceptualized as a dimmer switch (rather than an on/off switch), that unfolds over time. The articulatory features of the score are language universal (determined by the anatomy of the vocal tract), but utilized in language-specific ways. 

## Features

The more common way to conceptualize the building blocks of phonemes (as you've learned in LING1000) is by positing **features**. Features have some articulatory or acoustic or phonetic reality, but are really abstract units of speech that when combined with each other give use the contrastive phoneme. Below are some examples of phonological features:

[labial] -- Involving the lips\
[coronal] -- Involving the tongue tip or blade\
[dorsal] -- Involving the tongue body/rear\
[nasal] -- Involving velum lowering\
[continuant] -- Not full closure\
[consonantal] -- Not a vowel\
[voice] -- Vocal fold vibration for normal voicing\
[high] -- Low F1\
[back] -- Small distance between F1 and F2\

# Evidence for features

How do we know that features are real and have a pyshchological reality for the speaker and ultimately encoded in languages? One way we can see how features function in languages is by looking at universal (or near-universal) tendencies in language patterns. For example, co-occurrence restrictions in English there is a restriction on words of the shape sCVC such that both Cs cannot involve the same constriction.

So we have words like “snip”, but not *snim, *snom, *smung, etc. or it has “spot,” but not *spob, *smaf (But what about “spiffy”?)
English has “Scott,” but not *scock, *skong, etc. [But what about “skunk”].

Phonological processes like *assimilation*
