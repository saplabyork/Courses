Today's lecture continues with a description of sound and in particular its frequency and amplitude characteristics.

# Physical sound, mental percept

There are two ``domains'' in which we describe sound $\rightarrow$ the physical domain and the mental or perceptual domain. It's important to keep these two domains in mind and how they might not necessarily be in a one-to-one relationship. 

The physical properties of speech exist *outside* the realm of perception, that is, sound exists (as oscillating air molecules) even when there is no one to hear it.

So, physically, sound is the fluctuation (compression and rarefaction) of air molecules, but practically we're most often concerned with audible sound, that is, air fluctuations that actually displace your ear drum (make it move), which your brain then processes. The *perception* of sound is a psychological phenomenon, that affected by a lot of factors including the physical structure of the air fluctuations. 

## Frequency and pitch

The clearest examples of the relationship between the physical aspect of sound and its perception might be with respect to frequency and pitch. Recall our discussion last week on the frequency of periodic sounds. Frequency describes the rate at which an object vibrates (or how many times air molecules oscillate in one second).

Listen to this [sound](sounds/100_10000Hz_sweep.wav). The sound is a "tone sweep," starting off at 100Hz and ending at 10kHz, giving you the perception of low to high. For the most part, the higher the frequency, the higher the perception of pitch. 

# Vibrating objects

The frequency at which an object vibrates depends on its physical characteristics. Imagine the tonal characteristics of a metal bowl struck with a rubber mallet versus a glass bowl, or the characteristics of a tightly wound rope that is plucked versus a metal string.

## Tension and thickness

Can you guess which one is the steel string and which one is the nylon string? The notes are the same but their timbre is different as a result of the different properties of nylon (which is a type of plastic) versus metal. Not only are nylon strings physically different, but they are also under different **tensions** than the metal stringed guitar. As a result of being under less tension, nylon strings are more flexible, resulting in a "softer" sound, which ramps up in amplitude (in guitar or sound parlance, it has a slower "attack"). Keeping with the string analogy, the thickness of a string affects the frequency of its vibration. All else being equal (the material and the tension), the thicker string will vibrate more slowly than the thinner string.

All of this is to impress upon you that the frequency at which an object naturally vibrates is a result of its physical properties. 

## Length

Another physical property (as it relates to strings) is **length**. Shorter strings vibrate more quickly than longer strings. But here is a thought experiment, why does a stretched rubber band vibrate faster (when plucked), resulting in a higher pitch, than the same unstretched (shorter) rubber band?

## Relationships between frequencies

We already know that physical frequencies of sound give rise to a sense of pitch. For example, we've seen in Lecture 2 that the complex periodic sound with a fundamental frequency of 440Hz corresponds to the musical note with a pitch we call "A." That note can be perceived even when the physical frequency is not 440Hz. In fact, you perceive the note A when the physical frequency of the sound is half of or double 440Hz (so 220Hz and 880Hz). These notes are said to be an **octave** lower or higher than the root note A.
