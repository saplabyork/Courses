 # Models of production
 
 When we say "model" what do we mean? A model is a simplification of what we think is actually happening. Much like a model of a train, a model of of some behaviour is approximates many complexities, which are put into a perspective that is tractable, yet captures the major features of the *actual thing*. It allows us to better understand complex systems and behaviours.

Because speech production involves the coordination of lots of different physiological systems (e.g., respiration, phonation, articulation), we can attempt to model individual processes as well as larger systems to get a better sense of the relative timing and contribution of function to the speech process.
